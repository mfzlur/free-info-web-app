    <h1>Importance of Free Information Sources</h1>
    <p>
        Free information sources like <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> provide
        access to vast amounts of knowledge for everyone. They empower individuals, enhance learning, and promote
        equal access to information regardless of geographic or economic barriers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Creative Example: Imagine a world where knowledge isn't locked behind paywalls. Free sources like Wikipedia
        ensure we have access to scientific discoveries, historical records, and much more at our fingertips.
